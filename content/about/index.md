## Hello ðŸ‘‹!
I'm Bram and I'm an entrepreneur and engineer with a passion for technology. I run my own business, where we help companies leverage AI, from strategy to hands-on implementation.

In my work, I am especially interested in enabling companies leverage their own unique data and expertise to drive AI solutions that can deliver new insights, optimize processes or automate decision making. To that extend, I believe business should control their AI, and not overly depend on third party APIs. 

With my background, I am also deeply interested in the intersection of AI/ML and hardware: AI on the edge, computing systems and hardware acceleration.

## Bio
With a background in Electronics and Embedded Software, I spent the first part of my career in the semiconductor industry. At ASML I've [researched](https://www.scitepress.org/Link.aspx?doi=10.5220/0011145700003266) data-driven process learning for software control, after which I continued at Prodrive Technologies developing real-time sofware for computing in high-tech machines. 

Eventually I took on the role of Technical Director ECS at Prodrive, leading the Embedded Computing Systems Business Unit's product development. We developed large computing systems for use in semiconductor metrology, inspection, and machine vision.

Today I use my experience in building products and teams to help others navigate the opportunities and challenges of AI.

## Interests
Everything from transistors in chips to tokens in transformers! My curiosity spans the stack of digital technologies. Though my work is focusing on Artificial Intelligence, I still enjoy keeping up with developments in the semiconductor industry and leading edge chips.

Many of the applications I am working on now are running in the cloud, but I am still very much interested in the intersection of AI/ML and hardware.

High tech systems, embedded or industrial applications, and automation are areas I enjoy working in.

In my work at Arm, ASML and Prodrive, I have been fortunate to work in great teams, delivering great work. As program director, I have enjoyed shaping and leading such teams, and I am looking forward to do more of that in the future.

Outside of work I like to read, dance, play piano, or climb. I tinker with a homelab running on a Raspberry Pi, running plenty of small services. Besides that, I aim to experiment with writing and publishing some posts on this site.
